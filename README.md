# Map of the Software Defined Car

This is what I call the map of the software defined car.

It's something between advanced buzzword bingo and a well curated topic map with a bit of visual appealing design. 
Some crossings have a meaning, but not all. A missed topic does not mean it's not important. 
And yes, using a metro map to depict automotive topics may feel a bit awkward but I don't care.
